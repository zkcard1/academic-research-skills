# Academic Research Skills for Claude Code

[繁體中文版](README.zh-TW.md)

A comprehensive suite of Claude Code skills for academic research, covering the full pipeline from research to publication.

---

## Features

- **Deep Research** — 13-agent research team with Socratic guided mode + systematic review / PRISMA
- **Academic Paper** — 12-agent paper writing with LaTeX output hardening, visualization, revision coaching, and citation conversion
- **Academic Paper Reviewer** — Multi-perspective peer review with 0-100 quality rubrics (EIC + 3 dynamic reviewers + Devil's Advocate)
- **Academic Pipeline** — Full 10-stage pipeline orchestrator with adaptive checkpoints, claim verification, and material passport

### Full Pipeline

```
Research → Write → Integrity Check → Review (5-person) → Socratic Coaching
  → Revise → Re-Review → Re-Revise → Final Integrity Check → Finalize
  → Process Summary (with Collaboration Quality Evaluation)
```

**Key Features:**
1. Adaptive checkpoints (FULL / SLIM / MANDATORY) after every stage
2. Pre-review integrity verification — 100% reference, data, and claim validation (Phase A-E)
3. Two-stage review with Devil's Advocate + 0-100 quality rubrics
4. Socratic revision coaching between review and revision stages
5. Final integrity verification before publication
6. Output: MD + DOCX + LaTeX (APA 7.0 `apa7` class / IEEE / Chicago) → PDF via tectonic
7. Post-pipeline process summary with 6-dimension collaboration quality scoring (1–100)
8. Material passport for mid-entry provenance tracking
9. Cross-skill mode advisor (14 scenarios + user archetypes)

## Performance Notes

> **Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.6** with **Max plan** (or equivalent extended-thinking configuration).
>
> The full academic pipeline (10 stages) consumes a **large amount of tokens** — a single end-to-end run can exceed 200K input + 100K output tokens depending on paper length and revision rounds. Use at your discretion and budget accordingly.
>
> Individual skills (e.g., `deep-research` alone, or `academic-paper-reviewer` alone) consume significantly less.

## Prerequisites

### Install Claude Code

**Recommended: Native installer** (no Node.js required, auto-updates):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: npm install (deprecated)</summary>

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

</details>

### Set Up API Key

You need an Anthropic API key. Get one at https://console.anthropic.com/

```bash
# Claude Code will prompt for your API key on first run
claude
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

---

## Installation

### Method 1: As Project Skills (Recommended)

Clone this repo into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create skills directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Clone the skills
git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git .claude/skills/academic-research-skills
```

Then copy the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` content into your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (merge with existing if you have one).

> **Global installation:** To make skills available across all your projects, install to `~/.claude/skills/` instead:
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
> git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/academic-research-skills
> ```

### Method 2: As a Standalone Project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git

# Navigate to the project
cd academic-research-skills

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Don't have Git?</strong> Download as ZIP instead</summary>

1. Go to https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills
2. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP to your desired location
4. For Method 1: move the extracted folder to `.claude/skills/academic-research-skills` inside your project
5. For standalone use: open a terminal in the extracted folder and run `claude`

</details>

### Method 3: Claude Cowork (Desktop)

Use these skills in [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) — Claude Desktop's agentic workspace for knowledge work.

**Option A: Folder Access (Quickest)**

1. Clone this repo to a local folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git ~/academic-research-skills
   ```
2. Open Claude Desktop → click **Cowork** tab (top bar)
3. Select the cloned `academic-research-skills` folder as the working directory
4. Claude will auto-detect the skills from `SKILL.md` files and load them as needed

**Option B: As Project Skills**

If you already have a project folder in Cowork:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
mkdir -p .claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git .claude/skills/academic-research-skills
```

Skills will auto-load when relevant to your conversation — e.g., saying "help me write a paper" triggers `academic-paper`.

**Requirements:**
- Claude Desktop (latest version) with Cowork enabled
- Paid plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)

### Method 4: Upload to claude.ai

You can load these skills via claude.ai's Project feature without installing Claude Code.

**Steps:**

1. Download all 4 `SKILL.md` files from this repo:
   - `deep-research/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-paper/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-paper-reviewer/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md`

2. Sign in to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)

3. Create a new Project:
   - Click **Projects** → **Create Project** in the sidebar
   - Name it "Academic Research" (or any name you prefer)

4. Upload SKILL.md files:
   - Open the Project → click **Project Knowledge** (right panel)
   - Click **Add Content** → **Upload Files**
   - Upload all 4 `SKILL.md` files

5. (Optional) Upload reference and template files for better results:
   - Files under `deep-research/references/` (APA guide, methodology templates, etc.)
   - Files under `academic-paper/references/` (citation formats, writing style, etc.)
   - Files under `academic-paper/templates/` (paper structure templates)

6. Start chatting: Open a new conversation in the Project and say "Guide my research on X" or "Help me write a paper"

**claude.ai Limitations:**
- Project Knowledge file size limit: 200KB per file
- `version` and `last_updated` in SKILL.md YAML frontmatter must be under `metadata:`, otherwise upload will fail
- claude.ai does not support parallel multi-agent execution; results may not be as comprehensive as Claude Code
- Recommended: upload at least 4 SKILL.md files + core references for best results
