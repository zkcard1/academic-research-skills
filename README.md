## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js

Claude Code requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install node

# Windows (using winget)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS

# Linux (using nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

### Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Set Up API Key

You need an Anthropic API key. Get one at https://console.anthropic.com/

```bash
# Claude Code will prompt for your API key on first run
claude
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

## Installation

### Method 1: As Project Skills (Recommended)

Clone this repo into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create skills directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Clone the skills
git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git .claude/skills/academic-research-skills
```

Then copy the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` content into your project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (merge with existing if you have one).

### Method 2: As a Standalone Project

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Imbad0202/academic-research-skills.git

# Navigate to the project
cd academic-research-skills

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Method 3: Upload to claude.ai

You can load these skills via claude.ai's Project feature without installing Claude Code.

**Steps:**

1. Download all 4 `SKILL.md` files from this repo:
   - `deep-research/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-paper/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-paper-reviewer/SKILL.md`
   - `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md`

2. Sign in to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)

3. Create a new Project:
   - Click **Projects** → **Create Project** in the sidebar
   - Name it "Academic Research" (or any name you prefer)

4. Upload SKILL.md files:
   - Open the Project → click **Project Knowledge** (right panel)
   - Click **Add Content** → **Upload Files**
   - Upload all 4 `SKILL.md` files

5. (Optional) Upload reference and template files for better results:
   - Files under `deep-research/references/` (APA guide, methodology templates, etc.)
   - Files under `academic-paper/references/` (citation formats, writing style, etc.)
   - Files under `academic-paper/templates/` (paper structure templates)

6. Start chatting: Open a new conversation in the Project and say "Guide my research on X" or "Help me write a paper"

**claude.ai Limitations:**
- Project Knowledge file size limit: 200KB per file
- `version` and `last_updated` in SKILL.md YAML frontmatter must be under `metadata:`, otherwise upload will fail
- claude.ai does not support parallel multi-agent execution; results may not be as comprehensive as Claude Code
- Recommended: upload at least 4 SKILL.md files + core references for best results

## Usage

### Quick Start

```
# Start a full research pipeline
You: "I want to write a research paper on AI's impact on higher education QA"

# Start with Socratic guidance
You: "Guide my research on AI in educational evaluation"

# Write a paper with guided planning
You: "Guide me through writing a paper on demographic decline"

# Review an existing paper
You: "Review this paper" (then provide the paper)

# Check pipeline status
You: "status"
```

### Individual Skills

#### Deep Research
```
"Research the impact of AI on higher education" → full mode
"Guide my research on X" → socratic mode (guided)
"Fact-check these claims" → fact-check mode
"Do a literature review on X" → lit-review mode
```

#### Academic Paper
```
"Write a paper on X" → full mode
"Guide me through writing a paper" → plan mode (guided)
"Convert to LaTeX" → format-convert mode
"Check citations" → citation-check mode
```

#### Academic Paper Reviewer
```
"Review this paper" → full mode (EIC + R1/R2/R3 + Devil's Advocate)
"Guide me to improve this paper" → guided mode
"Check the methodology" → methodology-focus mode
"Verify the revisions" → re-review mode
```

#### Academic Pipeline (Orchestrator)
```
"I want to write a complete research paper" → full pipeline from Stage 1
"I already have a paper, review it" → mid-entry at Stage 2.5 (integrity first)
"I received reviewer comments" → mid-entry at Stage 4
```
