[繁體中文版](README.zh-TW.md)

A comprehensive suite of Claude Code skills for academic research, covering the full pipeline from research to publication.

> **AI is your copilot, not the pilot.** This tool won't write your paper for you. It handles the grunt work — hunting down references, formatting citations, verifying data, checking logical consistency — so you can focus on the parts that actually require your brain: defining the question, choosing the method, interpreting what the data means, and writing the sentence after "I argue that."
>
> Unlike a humanizer, this tool doesn't help you hide the fact that you used AI. It helps you write better. Style Calibration learns your voice from past work. Writing Quality Check catches the patterns that make prose feel machine-generated. The goal is quality, not cheating.

### Why human-in-the-loop, not full automation?

Lu et al. (2026, *Nature* 651:914-919) built **The AI Scientist** — the first fully autonomous AI research system to publish a paper through blind peer review at a top-tier ML venue (ICLR 2025 workshop, score 6.33/10 vs workshop average 4.87). It is the strongest published benchmark of what end-to-end autonomous AI research can do as of 2026.

Their own Limitations section enumerates the failure modes that any fully-autonomous AI research pipeline inherits:
- Implementation bugs that pass AI self-review but poison the results
- Hallucinated experimental results that look plausible
- Shortcut reliance (models exploiting spurious features and writing papers about "solving" the task)
- Implementation bugs reframed as novel insights
- Methodology fabrication (Methods section drifting from what was actually run)
- Frame-lock at early stages (wrong hyperparameter direction the pipeline cannot back out of)
- Citation hallucinations

ARS is built on the premise that **a human researcher augmented by AI avoids these failure modes better than either alone**. v3.2 directly operationalizes the Lu 2026 failure-mode taxonomy: the pipeline's Stage 2.5 and Stage 4.5 integrity gates now run a 7-mode blocking checklist (see `academic-pipeline/references/ai_research_failure_modes.md`), and the reviewer offers an opt-in calibration mode that measures its own FNR/FPR against a user-supplied gold set (see `academic-paper-reviewer/references/calibration_mode_protocol.md`).

The AI Scientist shows that autonomous AI research is now possible. ARS is designed to give you the leverage of that capability without inheriting its failure modes.

### Full Pipeline

```
Research → Write → Integrity Check → Review (5-person) → Socratic Coaching
  → Revise → Re-Review → Re-Revise → Final Integrity Check → Finalize
  → Process Summary (with Collaboration Quality Evaluation)
```

**Key Features:**
1. Adaptive checkpoints (FULL / SLIM / MANDATORY) after every stage
2. Pre-review integrity verification — 100% reference, data, and claim validation (Phase A-E)
3. Two-stage review with Devil's Advocate + 0-100 quality rubrics
4. Socratic revision coaching with SCR Loop (State-Challenge-Reflect, user-togglable) between review and revision stages
5. Final integrity verification before publication
6. Output: MD + DOCX + LaTeX (APA 7.0 `apa7` class / IEEE / Chicago) → PDF via tectonic
7. Post-pipeline process summary with 6-dimension collaboration quality scoring (1–100)
8. Material passport for mid-entry provenance tracking
9. Cross-skill mode advisor (14 scenarios + user archetypes)
10. Style Calibration — learn the author's writing voice from past papers (optional, intake Step 10)
11. Writing Quality Check — writing quality checklist catching overused AI-typical patterns
12. **Cross-model verification (optional)** — use GPT-5.4 Pro or Gemini 3.1 Pro as an independent second reviewer for integrity checks, DA challenges, and peer review

---

## Cross-Model Verification (Optional)

ARS works with Claude Opus 4.6 alone. For higher confidence, you can optionally enable a second AI model to independently verify integrity checks and challenge the devil's advocate.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Step 1: Set your API key (choose one or both)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"        # For GPT-5.4 Pro
export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY="AIza-your-key-here"    # For Gemini 3.1 Pro

# Step 2: Choose your cross-verification model
export ARS_CROSS_MODEL="gpt-5.4-pro"            # Best reasoning
# or: export ARS_CROSS_MODEL="gemini-3.1-pro-preview"  # Strong at factual verification

# Step 3: Run Claude Code as normal — cross-verification activates automatically
claude
```

### What Changes When Enabled

| Feature | Without Cross-Model | With Cross-Model |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Integrity verification | Single-model 100% check | + 30% sample independently verified by 2nd model |
| Devil's Advocate | Single-model DA | + Cross-model generates independent critique, novel findings added |
| Peer Review | 5 reviewers (same model) | + 6th independent reviewer from 2nd model |

### Cost

Full pipeline adds ~$0.60-1.10 in cross-model API costs (GPT-5.4 Pro pricing). See `shared/cross_model_verification.md` for detailed breakdown.

### No API Key? No Problem

Without `ARS_CROSS_MODEL` set, everything works exactly as before. The cross-model features are invisible and add zero overhead.

## Performance Notes

> **Recommended model: Claude Opus 4.6** with **Max plan** (or equivalent extended-thinking configuration).
>
> The full academic pipeline (10 stages) consumes a **large amount of tokens** — a single end-to-end run can exceed 200K input + 100K output tokens depending on paper length and revision rounds. Budget accordingly.
>
> Individual skills (e.g., `deep-research` alone, or `academic-paper-reviewer` alone) consume significantly less.

### Estimated Token Usage by Mode

| Skill / Mode | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Estimated Cost (Opus 4.6) |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| `deep-research` socratic | ~30K | ~15K | ~$0.60 |
| `deep-research` full | ~60K | ~30K | ~$1.20 |
| `deep-research` systematic-review | ~100K | ~50K | ~$2.00 |
| `academic-paper` plan | ~40K | ~20K | ~$0.80 |
| `academic-paper` full | ~80K | ~50K | ~$1.80 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` full | ~50K | ~30K | ~$1.10 |
| `academic-paper-reviewer` quick | ~15K | ~8K | ~$0.30 |
| **Full pipeline (10 stages)** | **~200K+** | **~100K+** | **~$4-6** |
| + Cross-model verification | +~10K (external) | +~5K (external) | +~$0.60-1.10 |

*Estimates based on a ~15,000-word paper with ~60 references. Actual usage varies with paper length, revision rounds, and dialogue depth. Costs at Anthropic API pricing as of April 2026.*

### Recommended Settings

For the best experience with these skills, enable the following Claude Code features:

| Setting | What it does | How to enable | Docs |
|---------|-------------|---------------|------|
| **Agent Team** | Spawns subagents for parallel research, writing, and review — critical for multi-agent pipelines | Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (research preview) | Experimental feature — no stable docs yet |
| **Ralph Loop** | Keeps the session alive during long-running pipeline stages so Claude can work autonomously without timing out | Use `/ralph-loop` to activate | Community plugin — experimental |
| **Skip Permissions** | Bypasses per-tool confirmation prompts, enabling uninterrupted autonomous execution across all pipeline stages | Launch with `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | [Permissions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-reference) · [Advanced Usage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/advanced) |

> **⚠️ Skip Permissions**: This flag disables all tool-use confirmation dialogs. Use at your own discretion — it is convenient for trusted, long-running pipelines but removes the safety net of manual approval. Only enable this in environments where you are comfortable with Claude executing file reads, writes, and shell commands without asking first.

---

## Prerequisites

### Install Claude Code

**Recommended: Native installer** (no Node.js required, auto-updates):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: npm install (deprecated)</summary>

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

</details>

### Set Up API Key

You need an Anthropic API key. Get one at https://console.anthropic.com/

```bash
# Claude Code will prompt for your API key on first run
claude
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx
```

### LaTeX / PDF Output (Optional)

PDF output requires [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/) and specific fonts. **This is optional** — MD and DOCX output work without any of this.

```bash
# macOS
brew install tectonic

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://drop-sh.fullyjustified.net | sh

# Windows
# Download from https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/install.html
```

**Required fonts** (for APA 7.0 CJK output):
- **Times New Roman** — usually pre-installed on macOS/Windows; on Linux install `ttf-mscorefonts-installer`
- **Source Han Serif TC VF** (思源宋體) — download from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif+TC) or [Adobe GitHub](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif)
- **Courier New** — usually pre-installed

> If you only need MD/DOCX output, skip this entirely. The pipeline will ask before attempting LaTeX compilation.

### Supported Languages

- **Traditional Chinese** (繁體中文) — default when user writes in Chinese
- **English** — default when user writes in English
- Bilingual abstracts (Chinese + English) for academic papers

> **Using a different language?** Socratic mode (deep-research) and Plan mode (academic-paper) use **intent-based activation** — they detect the meaning of your request, not specific keywords. This means they work in **any language** without modification.
>
> However, the general `Trigger Keywords` section (which determines whether the skill is activated at all) still lists English and Traditional Chinese keywords. If you find the skill isn't activating reliably in your language, you can add your language's keywords to the `### Trigger Keywords` section in each `SKILL.md` file to improve matching confidence.

## v3.0 Optimizations: What We Discovered About AI's Structural Limits

### What happened

While using ARS to write a reflection article about AI in higher education, I ran into three structural problems that no amount of prompt engineering could fix:

1. **Frame-lock**: I asked the AI to run a devil's advocate debate against its own thesis. It did — four rounds, each more refined than the last. But every round stayed inside the frame I'd set. The DA attacked arguments, never premises. It never asked "are we even discussing the right question?" This is the same pattern that caused the 31% citation error rate in v2.7's stress test: the verifying AI and the generating AI share the same cognitive frame.

2. **Sycophancy under pushback**: Every time I challenged the DA's attacks, it conceded too quickly. It retracted findings faster than it launched them. The model's training rewards conversational harmony — so "the user pushed back" was treated as evidence that the attack was wrong, when often it just meant the user was persistent.

3. **Intent misdetection**: The Socratic Mentor kept trying to converge and produce deliverables ("Want me to write this up?") when I was still exploring. It couldn't distinguish "the user wants a deep philosophical discussion" from "the user wants an RQ brief." Both look like engagement, but they need opposite AI behaviors.

### What we changed (v3.0)

**Devil's Advocate — Concession Threshold Protocol** (`deep-research` + `academic-paper-reviewer`)
- DA must now score every rebuttal on a 1-5 scale before responding
- Concession only allowed at score ≥4 (rebuttal directly addresses core attack with evidence)
- Score ≤3: hold position and restate the original attack
- Anti-sycophancy rules: no consecutive concessions, concession rate tracking, frame-lock detection after each checkpoint

**Socratic Mentor — Intent Detection Layer** (`deep-research`)
- Classifies user intent as exploratory vs. goal-oriented at dialogue start and every 3 turns
- Exploratory mode: disables auto-convergence, raises max rounds to 60, prohibits "want me to summarize?" prompts
- Goal-oriented mode: standard convergence behavior
- Anti-premature-closure rules: in exploratory mode, the user decides when to stop

**Socratic Mentor — Dialogue Health Indicator** (`deep-research`)
- Silent self-assessment every 5 turns on three dimensions: persistent agreement, conflict avoidance, premature convergence
- Auto-injects challenging questions when agreement pattern detected
- Invisible to user (to prevent gaming), but log available for post-session review

### Why this matters

These optimizations don't solve AI's structural limits — they make the limits visible and manageable. The DA will still eventually concede if pushed hard enough. The Socratic Mentor will still have some convergence bias. But now there are explicit checkpoints that slow down the sycophancy, force the DA to justify concessions, and prevent the Mentor from wrapping up before the user is ready.

The deeper lesson: AI literacy isn't about learning to use AI as a tool, following ethics rules, or fearing AI risks. It's about engaging AI deeply enough to discover its structural limits yourself — and your own thinking limits in the process.

### v3.1 (2026-04-06) — Anti-Context-Rot + Cognitive Frameworks + Lean Size

Inspired by patterns from [aspi6246/Claude-Code-Skills-for-Academics](https://github.com/aspi6246/Claude-Code-Skills-for-Academics).

**Wave 1: Anti-Context-Rot Anchors**
- 29 explicit Anti-Patterns across all 4 skills (7-8 per skill, tabular format with "Why It Fails" + "Correct Behavior")
- 22 IRON RULE markers on critical rules that must not be violated even in long conversations
- Read-only constraint on academic-paper-reviewer (reviewers cannot modify the manuscript)

**Wave 2: Traceability + Cognitive Frameworks + Reinforcement**
- R&R Traceability Matrix (Schema 11): adds "Author's Claim" and "Verified?" columns to re-review output, enabling independent verification of revision claims
- 3 cognitive framework reference files teaching agents "how to think" not just "what to do":
  - `argumentation_reasoning_framework.md` — Toulmin model, Bradford Hill causal reasoning, inference to best explanation, epistemic status classification
  - `review_quality_thinking.md` — three lenses (internal validity, external validity, contribution), common reviewer traps, calibration questions
  - `writing_judgment_framework.md` — clarity test, reader's journey, discipline-specific voice, revision decision matrix
- Mid-conversation reinforcement protocol: stage-specific IRON RULE + Anti-Pattern reminders at every pipeline transition
- Self-check questions at every FULL checkpoint (citation integrity, sycophantic concession, quality trajectory, scope discipline, completeness)

**Wave 3: Lean Skill Size**
- SKILL.md total size reduced from 142KB to 85KB (−40%) by extracting detailed protocols to `references/` files
- ~15 new reference files created (re-review protocol, guided mode, systematic review, process summary, external review, etc.)
- All IRON RULE markers preserved in SKILL.md; detailed content loaded on demand
- New versions: deep-research v2.7, academic-paper v2.8, academic-paper-reviewer v1.7, academic-pipeline v3.0

### v3.0 (2026-04-03) — Anti-Sycophancy + Intent Detection + Dialogue Health
- **Devil's Advocate Concession Threshold** (deep-research + academic-paper-reviewer): DA must score rebuttals 1-5 before responding. Concession only at ≥4. No consecutive concessions. Concession rate tracking. Frame-lock detection after each checkpoint.
- **Attack Intensity Preservation** (academic-paper-reviewer): DA does not soften under pushback. Rebuttal assessment protocol with explicit deflection detection. Anti-sycophancy rules prevent persistent pushback from being treated as valid evidence.
- **Intent Detection Layer** (deep-research socratic): Classifies user intent as exploratory vs. goal-oriented. Exploratory mode disables auto-convergence, raises max rounds, prohibits premature closure. Re-assesses every 3 turns.
- **Dialogue Health Indicator** (deep-research socratic): Silent self-check every 5 turns for persistent agreement, conflict avoidance, premature convergence. Auto-injects challenges when agreement pattern detected.
- **Cross-Model Verification Protocol** (shared, optional): Use GPT-5.4 Pro or Gemini 3.1 Pro as independent second reviewer. Integrity verification samples 30% of references for cross-check. DA gets independent critique from second model. Peer review gains 6th independent reviewer. Activated by setting `ARS_CROSS_MODEL` env var — without it, everything works as before. See `shared/cross_model_verification.md` for full setup guide, API patterns, and cost estimates.
- **AI Self-Reflection Report** (academic-pipeline Stage 6): Post-pipeline self-assessment of AI behavioral patterns — DA concession rate, checkpoint skip rate, health alerts, sycophancy risk rating (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), frame-lock incidents, convergence pattern analysis. Includes irony caveat: "this self-reflection is itself produced by the same AI that may have been sycophantic."
- Origin: Discovered through a 4-round dialectic experiment where the DA conceded too quickly, the Socratic Mentor tried to converge prematurely, and the entire debate stayed locked in a frame the human set.
- Versions: deep-research v2.5, academic-paper-reviewer v1.5, academic-pipeline v2.8

### v2.9 (2026-03-27) — Style Calibration + Writing Quality Check
- **Style Calibration** (academic-paper intake Step 10, optional): Provide 3+ past papers and the pipeline learns your writing voice — sentence rhythm, vocabulary preferences, citation integration style. Applied as a soft guide during drafting; discipline conventions always take priority. Priority system: discipline norms (hard) > journal conventions (strong) > personal style (soft). See `shared/style_calibration_protocol.md`
- **Writing Quality Check** (`academic-paper/references/writing_quality_check.md`): Writing quality checklist applied during draft self-review. 5 categories: AI high-frequency term warnings (25 terms), punctuation pattern control (em dash ≤3), throat-clearing opener detection, structural pattern warnings (Rule of Three, uniform paragraphs, synonym cycling), and burstiness checks (sentence length variation). These are good writing rules — not detection evasion
- **Style Profile** carried through academic-pipeline Material Passport (Schema 10 in `shared/handoff_schemas.md`)
- **deep-research** report compiler also consumes both features optionally
- Versions: academic-paper v2.5, deep-research v2.4, academic-pipeline v2.7

### v2.8 (2026-03-22) — SCR Loop Phase 1: State-Challenge-Reflect
- **Socratic Mentor Agent** (deep-research + academic-paper): SCR (State-Challenge-Reflect) protocol integration
  - **Commitment Gates**: Collect user predictions before presenting evidence at each layer/chapter transition
  - **Certainty-Triggered Contradiction**: Detect high-confidence language ("obviously", "clearly") and introduce counterpoints
  - **Adaptive Intensity**: Track commitment accuracy, dynamically adjust challenge frequency
  - **Self-Calibration Signal (S5)**: New convergence signal tracking user's self-calibration growth across dialogue
  - **SCR Switch**: Users can say "skip the predictions" to disable or "turn predictions back on" to re-enable mid-dialogue; Socratic questioning continues normally
- `deep-research/references/socratic_questioning_framework.md`: SCR Overlay Protocol mapping SCR phases to Socratic functions
- Added `CHANGELOG.md`

### v2.7 (2026-03-09) — Integrity Verification v2.0: Anti-Hallucination Overhaul
- **integrity_verification_agent v2.0**: Anti-Hallucination Mandate (no AI memory verification), eliminated gray-zone classifications (VERIFIED/NOT_FOUND/MISMATCH only), mandatory WebSearch audit trail for every reference, Stage 4.5 fresh independent verification, Gray-Zone Prevention Rule
- **Known Hallucination Patterns**: 5-type taxonomy (TF/PAC/IH/PH/SH) from GPTZero × NeurIPS 2025 study, 5 compound deception patterns, real-world case study, literature statistics
- **Post-publication audit**: Full WebSearch verification of all 68 references found 21 issues (31% error rate) that passed 3 rounds of integrity checks — proving the necessity of external verification
- **Paper corrections**: Removed 4 fabricated references, fixed 6 author errors, corrected 7 metadata errors, fixed 2 format issues

### v2.6.2 (2026-03-09) — Intent-Based Mode Activation
- **deep-research**: Socratic mode now uses **intent-based activation** instead of keyword matching. Works in any language — detects meaning (e.g., "user wants guided thinking") rather than matching specific strings.
- **academic-paper**: Plan mode now uses **intent-based activation**. Detects intent signals like "user is uncertain how to start" or "user wants step-by-step guidance" in any language.
- Both modes now have a **default rule**: when intent is ambiguous, prefer `socratic`/`plan` over `full` — safer to guide first.
- Two-layer architecture: Layer 1 (skill activation) uses bilingual keywords for matching confidence; Layer 2 (mode routing) uses language-agnostic intent signals.

### v2.6.1 (2026-03-09) — Bilingual Trigger Keywords
- **deep-research**: Added Traditional Chinese trigger keywords for general activation and Socratic mode.
- **academic-paper**: Added Traditional Chinese trigger keywords and Plan Mode trigger section.
- Both mode selection guides now include bilingual examples and Chinese-specific misselection scenarios.
