# Academic Paper — Academic Paper Writing Agent Team

A general-purpose academic paper writing tool — 12-agent pipeline covering all disciplines, with higher education domain as the default reference.

**v2.5** adds two writing quality features:
- **Style Calibration** (intake Step 10, optional) — Provide 3+ past papers and the pipeline learns your writing voice (sentence rhythm, vocabulary preferences, citation integration style). Applied as a soft guide during drafting; discipline conventions always take priority. See `shared/style_calibration_protocol.md`.
- **Writing Quality Check** (`references/writing_quality_check.md`) — A writing quality checklist applied during the draft self-review step. Catches overused AI-typical terms, em dash overuse, throat-clearing openers, uniform paragraph lengths, and monotonous sentence rhythm. These are good writing rules, not detection evasion.

## Quick Start

**Minimal command:**
```
Write a paper on the impact of AI on higher education quality assurance
```

```
Write a paper on the impact of declining birth rates on private university management strategies
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Configuration interview — paper type, discipline, citation format, output format
2. Literature search — systematic search strategy, source screening
3. Architecture design — paper structure, outline, word count allocation
4. Argumentation construction — claim-evidence chains, logical flow
5. Full-text drafting — section-by-section draft, register adjustment
6. Citation compliance + bilingual abstract (parallel)
7. Peer review — five-dimension scoring, revision suggestions
8. Output formatting — LaTeX/DOCX/PDF/Markdown

## Trigger Conditions

### Trigger Keywords

**English**: write paper, academic paper, paper outline, write abstract, revise paper, literature review paper, check citations, convert to LaTeX, convert format, format paper, conference paper, journal article, thesis chapter, research paper, guide my paper, help me plan my paper, step by step paper, draft manuscript, write methodology, write discussion, parse reviews, revision roadmap, help me with my revision, I got reviewer comments, convert citations

**繁體中文**: 寫論文, 學術論文, 論文大綱, 寫摘要, 修改論文, 文獻回顧論文, 檢查引用, 轉 LaTeX, 轉換格式, 研討會論文, 期刊文章, 學位論文, 研究論文, 引導我寫論文, 幫我規劃論文, 逐步寫論文, 寫方法論, 寫討論, 審查意見, 修訂路線圖, 幫我修改, 我收到審查意見, 轉換引用格式

### Plan Mode Activation

Activate `plan` mode (Socratic chapter-by-chapter guidance) when the user's **intent** matches any of the following patterns, **regardless of language**. Detect meaning, not exact keywords.

**Intent signals** (any one is sufficient):
1. User wants to be guided or led through paper writing, not just given a finished paper
2. User asks for step-by-step or chapter-by-chapter planning
3. User expresses uncertainty about how to start or structure a paper
4. User is a first-time paper writer or explicitly says they are a beginner
5. User has research results but doesn't know how to turn them into a paper
6. User wants to think through each section before writing

**Default rule**: When intent is ambiguous between `plan` and `full`, **prefer `plan`** — it is safer to guide a user who needs help than to produce a paper they can't use. The user can always switch to `full` later.

**Example triggers** (illustrative, not exhaustive):
"guide my paper", "help me plan my paper", "I don't know how to start", 「引導我寫論文」「幫我規劃論文」, or equivalent in any language

### Does NOT Trigger

| Scenario | Use Instead |
|----------|-------------|
| Deep research / fact-checking (not paper writing) | `deep-research` |
| Reviewing a paper (structured review) | `academic-paper-reviewer` |
| Full research-to-paper pipeline | `academic-pipeline` |

### Distinction from `deep-research`

| Feature | `academic-paper` | `deep-research` |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Primary output | Publishable paper draft | Research report |
| Structure | Journal-ready (IMRaD, etc.) | APA 7.0 report |
| Citation | Multi-format (APA/Chicago/MLA/IEEE/Vancouver) | APA 7.0 only |
| Abstract | Bilingual (zh-TW + EN) | Single language |
| Peer review | Simulated 5-dimension review | Editorial review |
| Output format | LaTeX/DOCX/PDF/Markdown | Markdown only |
| Revision loop | Max 2 rounds with targeted feedback | Max 2 rounds |

         - Register adjustment for discipline
         - In-text citations integrated
         - Word count tracking per section
         - Transition paragraphs between sections
     |
=== Phase 5a & 5b: CITATIONS + ABSTRACT (Parallel) ===

### Checkpoint Rules

1. **Phase 0 -> 1**: User must confirm Paper Configuration Record
2. **Phase 2 -> 3**: User must approve outline (can request restructuring)
3. **Phase 6**: Max 2 revision loops; unresolved items -> "Acknowledged Limitations"
4. **Peer Review** Critical-severity issues block progression to Phase 7
5. User can skip Phase 1 (literature) if providing own sources

## Operational Modes (9 Modes)

See `references/mode_selection_guide.md` for details.

| Mode | Trigger | Agents | Output |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| `full` | "Write a paper" | All 9 (+ 11 if quantitative) | Complete paper draft (with figures if applicable) |
| `outline-only` | "Paper outline" | 1->2->3 | Detailed outline + evidence map |
| `revision` | "Revise paper" | 8->5->6 | Revised draft with tracked changes (uses `templates/revision_tracking_template.md`) |
| `abstract-only` | "Write abstract" | 1->7 | Bilingual abstract + keywords |
| `lit-review` | "Literature review" | 1->2 | Annotated bibliography + synthesis |
| `format-convert` | "Convert to LaTeX" / "Convert citations to [format]" | 9 only | Formatted document; includes citation format conversion (APA 7 / Chicago / MLA / IEEE / Vancouver) |
| `citation-check` | "Check citations" | 6 only | Citation error report |
| `plan` | "guide my paper" / "help me plan my paper" | 1->10->3->4 | Chapter Plan + INSIGHT Collection |
| `revision-coach` | "parse reviews" / "revision roadmap" / "I got reviewer comments" | 12 only | Revision Roadmap + optional Tracking Template + Response Letter Skeleton |

### Quick Mode Selection Guide

| Your Situation | Recommended Mode |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Starting from scratch with a clear RQ | `full` |
| Need help planning before writing | `plan` |
| Just need an outline | `outline-only` |
| Have a draft, received review feedback | `revision` |
| Have unstructured reviewer comments | `revision-coach` |
| Just need an abstract | `abstract-only` |
| Need to check/fix citations | `citation-check` |
| Need to convert format (LaTeX, DOCX) or citation style | `format-convert` |
| Want a systematic literature review paper | `lit-review` |

Not sure? Start with `plan` — it will guide you step by step.

### Mode Selection Logic

```
"Write a paper on SDGs in HEI"           -> full
"Give me a paper outline for..."         -> outline-only
"Revise this paper based on feedback"    -> revision
"Write an abstract for this paper"       -> abstract-only
"Do a literature review on..."           -> lit-review
"Convert this paper to LaTeX"            -> format-convert
"Convert citations to IEEE"              -> format-convert
"Check the citations in this paper"      -> citation-check
"guide my paper"                         -> plan
"help me plan my paper"                  -> plan
"I got reviewer comments"               -> revision-coach
"parse these reviews"                    -> revision-coach
"help me with my revision"              -> revision-coach
```

## Plan Mode: CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER GUIDED PLANNING

Core principle: From the perspective of a senior doctoral advisor and disciplinary methodology expert, guide users to think through every part of their paper chapter by chapter. Instead of writing directly, use Socratic dialogue to help users clarify what they want to write.

```
User: "guide my paper" / "help me plan my paper"
     |
=== Step 0: RESEARCH READINESS CHECK ===
     |
     +-> [socratic_mentor_agent] -> Confirm what materials the user already has
         - "What research materials do you currently have? (literature, data, analysis results)"
         - "Is your research question finalized? Can you state it in one sentence?"
         -> If research foundation is lacking, recommend running deep-research (socratic mode) first
     |
=== Step 1: THESIS CRYSTALLIZATION ===
     |
     +-> [socratic_mentor_agent] -> Probe the core thesis
         - "What is your paper arguing?"
         - "How would someone who disagrees with you respond?"
         - "After reading your paper, what should the reader think differently about?"
         Extract [INSIGHT: thesis_statement]
     |
=== Step 2: CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER NEGOTIATION ===
     |
     For each chapter (Introduction -> Literature -> Method -> Results -> Discussion -> Conclusion):
     |
     +-> [socratic_mentor_agent] -> Probe the purpose and content of each chapter
     |
     |   Introduction:
     |   - "What sense of urgency should the reader feel by the end of this chapter?"
     |   - "After reading the Introduction, what should the reader expect to see next?"
     |   - "What is your research gap? State it in one sentence."
     |
     |   Literature Review:
     |   - "How many stories are you telling? What is the relationship between them?"
     |   - "What conclusion should your literature review ultimately lead to?"
     |   - "Is there an important work you disagree with? Why?"
     |
     |   Methodology:
     |   - "If someone challenges your method, how would you respond?"
     |   - "Is there a simpler method that could also answer your question? Why didn't you choose it?"
     |   - "What is the biggest limitation of your method? How do you handle it?"
     |
     |   Results:
     |   - "What is your most important finding? State it in one sentence."
     |   - "Were there any unexpected results? How do you explain them?"
     |   - "Is there any evidence in your data that does not support your hypothesis?"
     |
     |   Discussion:
     |   - "How do your results dialogue with existing literature?"
     |   - "What is the one thing you most want the reader to remember?"
     |   - "What recommendations does your research have for practice/policy?"
     |
     |   Conclusion:
     |   - "If you could only leave one paragraph, what would you say?"
     |   - "What future research directions does your study open up?"
     |
     At least 2 rounds of dialogue per chapter
     After each chapter concludes, [socratic_mentor_agent] extracts a Chapter Summary
     |
     +-> [structure_architect_agent] -> Produce complete outline based on all Chapter Summaries
     |
=== Step 3: ARGUMENT STRESS TEST ===
     |
     +-> [socratic_mentor_agent + argument_builder_agent]
         -> Probe evidence and logic for each sub-argument
         -> "Where is the weakest point in this argument?"
         -> "If you reverse your argument, does it still hold?"
         -> Final output: Chapter Plan (with core argument, supporting evidence, expected word count per chapter)
     |
Output: Chapter Plan + INSIGHT Collection
-> User can then use full mode to produce the complete paper
-> Or use academic-paper-reviewer to review the Chapter Plan
```

## Handoff Protocol: deep-research -> academic-paper

`intake_agent` automatically detects deep-research materials (RQ Brief / Bibliography / Synthesis / INSIGHT Collection) and skips redundant steps. See `deep-research/SKILL.md` Handoff Protocol for the complete handoff material format.

---

## Failure Paths

See `references/failure_paths.md` for details. Quick reference:

| Failure Scenario | Handling Strategy |
|---------|---------|
| Insufficient research foundation | Recommend running `deep-research` first |
| Wrong paper structure selected | Return to Phase 2, suggest alternative structure |
| Word count significantly over/under target | Identify problematic chapters, suggest trimming/expansion |
| Citation format entirely wrong | Re-run the entire citation phase |
| Peer review rejection | Analyze rejection reasons, suggest major revision or restructuring |
| Plan mode not converging | Suggest switching to outline-only mode |
| Incomplete handoff materials | List missing items, suggest supplementing or re-running |
| User abandons midway | Save completed Chapter Plan |

---

## Full Academic Pipeline

See `academic-pipeline/SKILL.md` for the complete workflow.

---

## Phase 0: Configuration Interview

See `agents/intake_agent.md` for the complete field definitions of the Phase 0 configuration interview. The interview covers 9 items: paper type, discipline, target journal, citation format, output format, language, abstract, word count, and existing materials. Outputs a Paper Configuration Record, awaiting user confirmation.

## Quality Standards

### Writing Quality
1. **Every claim must have a citation** or be supported by the paper's own data
2. **Zero citation orphans** — in-text citations <-> reference list must perfectly match
3. **Consistent register** — academic tone appropriate for the discipline
4. **Logical flow** — clear transitions between paragraphs and sections
5. **Word count compliance** — within +/-10% of target

### Bilingual Abstract Quality
6. **Independent writing** — zh-TW and EN abstracts are independently composed, NOT mechanical translations
7. **Structural alignment** — both abstracts cover the same key points in the same order
8. **Keywords** — 5-7 per language, reflecting the paper's core concepts
9. **Word count** — EN: 150-300 words; zh-TW: 300-500 characters

### Citation Quality
10. **Format compliance** — 100% adherence to selected citation style
11. **DOI inclusion** — every source with a DOI must include it
12. **Currency** — flag sources older than 10 years (unless seminal works)
13. **Self-citation ratio** — flag if >15%

### Peer Review
14. **Five dimensions** — Originality (20%), Methodological Rigor (25%), Evidence Sufficiency (25%), Argument Coherence (15%), Writing Quality (15%)
15. **Actionable feedback** — every criticism must include a specific suggestion
16. **Max 2 revision rounds** — unresolved items become Acknowledged Limitations

### Mandatory Inclusions
17. **AI disclosure statement** — every paper must include a statement on AI tool usage
18. **Limitations section** — explicitly discuss study limitations
19. **Ethics statement** — when applicable (human subjects, sensitive data)

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 2.5 | 2026-03-27 | Style Calibration (intake Step 10: learn author's writing voice from 3+ past papers, produce Style Profile with 6 dimensions, consumed by draft_writer as soft guide with discipline-convention priority).
